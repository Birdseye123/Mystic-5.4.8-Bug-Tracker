-- FAQ --

1. Will the 5.4.8 replace our server? 
A. Yes, but once we'll validate its working properly.

2. Will there be an entire character reset?
A. No, we'll just update our database.

3. What will be able to see for the server release?
A. Possible a lot of spell fixes, stability fixes and as for our pve content: Throne Of Thunder fully coded.

4. Will this means 5.0.5 development pace will be slowed down?
A. No, if we can decent bug tracker reports on our website we'll resolve them regardless of this PTR.

5. I reported an issue but it didn't got fixed, shall i report it again?
A. Typically I'd say no, because at start you can expect tons of issues - so you'll have to understand that we'll have
a lot to do, so if the bug isn't critical to our opinion we'll not tend to it that fast. If the issue is there for over
a month without any notice from us then yes - repost the bug on our bug tracker.
